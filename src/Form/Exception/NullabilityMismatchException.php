/**
 * Thrown when a Doctrine field's DB-level `nullable` mapping disagrees with
 * its PHP property's own type nullability in a way DoctrineFormTypeMapper
 * cannot safely resolve on its own: Doctrine says the column may hold NULL,
 * but the PHP property type does not allow null.
 *
 * A NULL database row would crash the moment that property is read (either
 * during Doctrine hydration or while DynamicEntityFormType builds the
 * FormView); the form layer has no safe way to paper over that, so it fails
 * loudly and early — at form-build time, naming the exact field — rather
 * than leaving it to surface later as an unexplained TypeError.
 *
 * Fix the entity, not this exception: either widen the PHP property to a
 * nullable type, or set nullable: false on the Doctrine column mapping so
 * the two agree. The reverse combination (Doctrine nullable: false + a
 * nullable PHP property) is fine and common — it's exactly the shape a
 * "new entity" form needs for a required field that has no value yet — and
 * never triggers this exception.
